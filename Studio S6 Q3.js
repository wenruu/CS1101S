/*Your friend Louis Reasoner has a pocket full of change. He wants to buy a snack that will
cost him x cents, and he wants to know all the ways in which he can use his change to
make up that amount. Please help him in writing a function which takes as parameters the
amount x and a list of all the coins Louis has in his pocket, and returns a list of lists, such

that each sub-list of the result contains a valid combination to make up x. A combination
may appear more than once, since it may be using different coins of the same denomination.
Help Louis by filling in the ellipses ... in his incomplete solution:*/
